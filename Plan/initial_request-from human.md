OK you were helping me plan for a new project which will train a open source open weights small language model on a series of PDFS that I've downloaded on very important topics related to market analysis health care data sets and product development. We need an architecture that can run entirely locally initially Ultimately we may use a VPC. Suggest which software I need to have locally installed on my PC I'm very familiar with lmstudio but I'm also very willing to try additional packages, something is pulling me towards tensor flow. Output your suggestions and questions in a markdown file in the folder called plan. And explain the differences between what I should be doing Ultimately this model I would like to modify such that it is advising citing Sources from the training data set, this will an ongoing training process. Also use web research to investigate which model is most appropriate given my current PC setup and hardware. Also explain the mechanics of pre training training and fine tuning with respect to changing weights in a neural network behind the scenes of the LLM. Ask me questions one at a time to refine your direction
